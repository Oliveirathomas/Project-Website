   <p>My name is Thomas Oliveira. I am passionate about technology and mechanics. Since I was a little boy, I remember receiving an electronic toy and taking it apart to see how it works. From this passion for radio model control, karts, motorcycles and car restoration, it was how i  developed my passion.  <br> <br> So when the time as come i applied to a degree in Mechanical Engineering at ISEP, which unfortunately I did not finish. <br> <br> Since that i managed my parents' restaurant in Oporto busy street of Cedofeita for several years (32 years in 2022 since they open it!), always with the same focus and desire as in everything I do. Implemented several digital tools, marketing and a more current view of the market. I learned a lot during those almost 15 years, from managing human resources, stock, training and everything else related to a business. <br>  <br> But the passion for the IT area was never lost ,and the missing part to understand how it works. So I decided to deepen my knowledge in the backend and frontend area. I joined Rumos for a Full Stack Developer course and together I added other languages ​​and tools. <br>  <br> I believe I can help simplify the common user's day-to-day life in a way that is as natural as possible. <br> <br> On this site I try to leave references to acquired knowledge and projects.</p>
